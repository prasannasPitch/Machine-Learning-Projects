1. Model Selection Using Grid Search Cross Validation : 

<p align="justify">
GridSearchCV lets you combine an estimator with a grid search preamble to tune hyper-parameters. The method picks the optimal parameter from the grid search and uses it with the estimator selected by the user. For a given classification problem, the model hyper parameters are fed and GridSearchCV tries out the possible combination of hyper parameters. Finally we get the best possible scores for the dataset. The models used in this project are SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Gaussian and Decision Tree. It happens that SVM with the parameters {'C': 10, 'gamma': 0.001, 'kernel': 'rbf'} performed well on this dataset.
